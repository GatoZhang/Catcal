# Catcal
The calculator I wrote in my bachelor's study. For personal interests and understanding JAVA and OOP, I did this "work" in 2016.
As this is for fun, there is no comment in the code so far. In addition, the code doesn't totally show the philosophy of OOP due to my strange motivation. Maybe I will add the comment and optimize the code when I get older.

The main.java contains the main code for the calculator, including the code for the panel and the code for different operations.
The stack.java has the class of the stack data structure, which is the key to solve the operation priority problem.
